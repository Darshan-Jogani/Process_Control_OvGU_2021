# Process_Control_OvGU_2021
Project task of Process Control 'Control of a Multivariable Process' at OvGU in 2021 

> This project involves mathematical modeling and analysis of degrees of freedom, steady-state solutions of ODE systems, and dynamic behavior simulation with step change scenarios in MATLAB and Simulink. It also includes numerical linearization, stability analysis of a linearized process model, and the design and testing of suitable controllers for performance under step change conditions.
